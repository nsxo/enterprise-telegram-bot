# ðŸš€ Deployment Notes for Enterprise Telegram Bot

## **Automatic Deployment Process**

The bot now includes **automatic setup** that runs during startup to ensure all necessary components are in place.

### **What Happens Automatically:**

1. âœ… **Database Migrations** - All schema updates applied
2. âœ… **Product Creation** - Sample products created if none exist
3. âœ… **Command Registration** - All user commands including `/balance` and `/time`
4. âœ… **Health Checks** - Verification that everything is working

### **Using the Deploy Script:**

```bash
# Automated deployment to Railway
./deploy.sh
```

This script will:
- Commit and push your changes
- Trigger Railway deployment
- Wait for deployment completion
- Check health endpoints
- Verify the bot is ready

---

## **Manual Setup (If Needed)**

If automatic setup fails or you need to run setup manually:

### **Option 1: Railway CLI**
```bash
# Run comprehensive setup
railway run python scripts/deploy_setup.py

# Or just ensure products exist
railway run python scripts/ensure_products.py
```

### **Option 2: Local Development**
```bash
# For local testing (requires local database)
python scripts/deploy_setup.py
python scripts/ensure_products.py
```

---

## **Post-Deployment Verification**

### **1. Health Check**
```bash
curl https://your-railway-app.up.railway.app/health
```

### **2. Test Bot Commands**
- `/start` - Should show welcome with tutorial options
- `/balance` - Should display credit balance with progress bar
- `/buy` - Should show product catalog (not empty)
- `/buy10` - Should work without system errors
- `/help` - Should list all available commands
- `/time` - Should show current time

### **3. Check Logs**
```bash
railway logs
```

Look for these success messages:
- `âœ… Product setup completed`
- `ðŸŽ‰ Successfully ensured X products exist`
- `âœ… All plugins loaded and handlers registered successfully`

---

## **Troubleshooting**

### **If Products Are Still Missing:**

1. **Check startup logs** for product creation errors
2. **Run manual setup:**
   ```bash
   railway run python scripts/deploy_setup.py
   ```
3. **Verify database connection** and permissions

### **If Commands Don't Work:**

1. **Check that all plugins loaded successfully** in logs
2. **Verify no database connection errors**
3. **Test with `/help` to see available commands**

### **If Purchase Flow Fails:**

1. **Ensure products exist** (run `scripts/ensure_products.py`)
2. **Check Stripe configuration** and webhook endpoints
3. **Verify database schema** is up to date
